<div id=reportinfo class=noprint>
<p>List of requested titles picked up or cancelled in the previous calendar month</p>
<ul><li>Shows requests in the previous calendar month</li>
<li>at the request pickup library you specify</li>
<li>grouped by reserveid number</li>
<li>sorted by the pickup library plus the normal Next classification order</li>
</ul><br />
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p></p>
<p>If a request shows up in this report with no classification information it's because no specific item was ever assigned to fill this request.  This can happen in several situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first situation would be if a title level request was placed and then cancelled before an available item reached the top of the requests queue</li>
<li>The second situation would be if a request was placed and an item was checked out to the borrower that filled that request before an available item reached the top of the requests queue</li>
<li>The third situation would be if an item was checked out to the borrower that was deleted after the item was returned but before this report was run</li>
</ul>
