<div id=reportinfo class=noprint>
<p>Shows borrowers sorted by their "Last borrowed" date but only if the last borrowed date was less than 25 months in the past.</p>
<ul><li>With the home library you specify</li>
<li>grouped by borrowernumber</li>
<li>sorted by LAST_BORROWED date</li>
<li>links to the borrower record</li>
</ul><br />
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p></p>
<p>This report gets the "LAST_BORROWED" dates from the statistics table in Koha.  As a matter of data security, Next Search Catalog only keeps data in the statistics table for the previous 25 months, therefore, the "LAST_BORROWED" date will never be more than 25 months in the past.</p>
