<div id=reportinfo>
<p>Counts circulation (checkouts + renewals) on items checked out between DATE1 and DATE2 and groups them by shelving location</p>
<ul><li>Shows items checked out or renewed between two specified dates (between 12:00 a.m. on DATE1 and 11:59 p.m. on DATE2</li>
<li>shows items checked out at the specified library</li>
<li>grouped by item check-out branch</li>
<li>sorted by item check-out branch and shelving location</li>
</ul><br />
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p>Location data is based on the shelving location of the item at the time the report was run - not the time when the item circulated.</p>
<p>Report created by GHW at the request of LEAVENWRTH so they could track circulation of items on display.</p>
<p>Items without a shelving location will be recorded as having a shelving location of "Processing Center."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Updated on 2019.07.15 to include changes based on additional shelving locations.</p>
