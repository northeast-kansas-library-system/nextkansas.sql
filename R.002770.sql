<div id=reportinfo>
<p>Counts circulation (checkouts + renewals) on items checked out between the beginning of the day on DATE1 and the end of the day on DATE2 and groups them by shelving location</p>
<ul><li>Shows items checked out or renewed between two specified dates (between 12:00 a.m. on DATE1 and 11:59 p.m. on DATE2</li>
<li>shows items checked out at the specified library</li>
<li>grouped by item check-out branch</li>
<li>sorted by item check-out branch and shelving location</li>
</ul><br />
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p class="updated">SHELVING_LOCATION is based on the shelving location of the item at the time it was checked out *Unless the item had a "Recently returned" shelving location.*  This report falls back to the items' "Permanent shelving location" whenever the statistics data shows that the item's shelving location was "Recently returned."</p>
<p>Report created by GHW at the request of LEAVENWRTH so they could track circulation of items on display.</p>
<p>Items without a shelving location will be recorded as having a shelving location of "Adult."</p>
<p></p>
<p class="updated">Updated on 2021.10.20 to include changes based on the "Recently returned" shelving location.</p>
