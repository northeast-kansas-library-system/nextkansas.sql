This is a slow report. Please be patient. You'll need to choose your library branch twice. 

This report can be used for shelf checking on materials that patrons say they returned with other materials. It reports on patrons who have returned materials in the past 3 days, who have still have materials due in the past three days or next three days, who still have items checked out.
