<div id=reportinfo style="font-size:14px; font-weight:normal; background-color:#FFFF66">
<p>Shows accountline information for a particular item if the item's barcode number has been stored in the accountlines description field</p>
<ul><li>Shows all accountlines related to the item barcode number specified</li>
<li>Shows accountlines related to that item regardless as to which item owns the item or is owed the fee</li>
<li>grouped and sorted by patron barcode number and accountline id</li>
<li>links to the patron's fine history</li>
</ul><br />
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p></p>
<p>This report can only show the fines history on an item if the fee is unpaid or was paid less than 25 months ago.</p>
<p>In older version of Koha, the item barcode number was not always stored in the description field.  If the item's barcode number was not stored in the description field, this report cannot recover the data about the fee history.</p>
<p>This report will show any entries in the patron's fee history - fees, credits, writeoffs, etc.  The only requirement is that the fee description contains the item barcode number you are searching for.</p>
