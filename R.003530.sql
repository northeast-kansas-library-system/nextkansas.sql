<p></p> 
<p>This report cannot track changes made to existing records over time.  Therefore, if staff change the home library, location, or item type of an item, those changes will not be reflected in the additions or deletions columns.  This means that the numbers may look inconsistent from month to month if changes are made to item records.</p>
