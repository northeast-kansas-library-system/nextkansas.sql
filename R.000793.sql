<p>Counts the number of items that were put in transit to fill requests at other libraries</p>
<ul><li>during the month you specify</li>
<li>Based on the item's home library</li>
<li>grouped by library and shipping or receiving date</li>
<li>sorted by library name</li>

<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p></p>
<p>NX_ILL_LOANED_LM = the number of items owned by your library that were shipped "in transit" to another library during the month.</p>
<p>NX_ILL_BORROWED_LM = the number of items not owned by your library that arrived "in transit" to your library during the month.</p>
<p>This report does not take into account whether the item was actually checked out by a borrower - it only considers that the item was shipped from or to your library.</p>
<p>Replaces report 794.</p>
