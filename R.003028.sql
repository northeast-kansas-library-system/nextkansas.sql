<div id=reportinfo>
<p>Counts circulation (checkouts and renewals) based on flexible date settings</p>
<ul><li>Counts circulation based on the date parameters you set</li>
<li>at the library you choose</li>
<li>grouped and sorted by checkout branch and date of checkout</li>
</ul><br />
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p></p>
<p>Please note that items renewed via the OPAC are counted as renewals at the library where the item was checked out.  Therefore, if you see a circulation count at a library on a day that the library is normally closed, it is almost certainly due to a renewal initiated by the patron via the OPAC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This report replaces reports 2396, 2397, 2398, 2399, 2400, 2401, and 2402</p>
