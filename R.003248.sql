<p>Generates total value of all items checked out during the calendar month you specify at the library you specify</p>
<ul><li>Shows value of items checkered out during the month you specify</li>
<li>at the library you specify (no matter which library owned the item)</li>
<li>grouped by replacement price, check-out branch, item type, item number, date and time of checkout, library name, and item type description.</li>
<li>sorted by checkout library and item type description</li>
<li>links</li>
</ul><br />
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Summarizes the replacement cost of every item checked out, every time it was checked out at the specified library during the month specified.  If, for example, a $10.00 MOVIE checks out 5 times at one library during June of 2018, those checkouts will contribute $50.00 to the total in the column for "MOVIE" at that library for June 2018.</li>
<li>This report relies on the accuracy of the data in the 952$v field.  If, for example, the 952$v field has accidentally been sent to $999,999.99 for an item, each time that item checks out in a month, the total value for the VALUE_OF_ALL_ITEMS_CHECKED_OUT column will increase by slightly less than one million dollars.  Similarly, if the 952$v is left blank, no value will be recorded.</li>
<li>This report only looks at check-outs - it does not record data for renewals.</li>
<li>Data in the statistics table is only kept for the previous 25 months.  This report will not be able to report on dates more than 25 months ago.</li>
<li>The further back in time you look, the less reliable the data will be.  It's best to run this report on the first of each month to capture data for the preceding month and then store that data locally rather than to rely on data stored in the ever-changing production environment.</li>
</ul>
