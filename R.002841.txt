<div id=reportinfo>
<p>Counts check-outs, renewals, and check-ins on an hourly basis</p>
<ul><li>Shows activity during the date range you specify (between the beginning of the day on the specified "START DATE" to the end of the day on the specified "END DATE")</li>
<li>also allows you to specify a day of the week (in case you just want to see activity on Wednesdays, for example)</li>
<li>shows activity at a branch you specify</li>
<li>shows the type of activity you specify (check-ins; check-outs; returns; etc.)</li>
<li>grouped by circulation branch, date, day of the week, hour of the day (in 24 hour format), and type of activity (issue=check-out; renew=renewal; return=check-in; localuse=statical card)</li>
</ul><br />
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p></p>
<p>Replaces report 590</p>
<p></p>
<p>The hour shows in military format - i.e. 13=1:00 p.m., 18=6:00 p.m., etc.</p>
<p>Koha counts renewals as happening at the location where the initial check-out happened - i.e. if an item was renewed by the patron via the OPAC, it counts as a renewal at the branch where the item was checked out (This is why you may see renewals on days your library is normally closed).</p>
