Normally this would go under administrative reports, as it has no branch limits, but it's useful for all libraries. It simply lists all titles & title info for a specific collection code in the system.

SELECT biblio.title, ExtractValue(biblio_metadata.metadata, '//datafield[@tag="245"]/subfield[@code>="b"]') as 'Remainder of Title' FROM items JOIN biblio USING(biblionumber) LEFT JOIN biblio_metadata USING(biblionumber) WHERE items.ccode=<<Pick your ccode|CCODE>> GROUP BY biblionumber ORDER BY biblio.title
