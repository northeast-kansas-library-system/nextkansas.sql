Report for GHW to create mail merge contact information sheet and for cleaning up problems with branch information in Koha (data is inconsistent - some address1 fields are street addresses and some are PO boxes - some address2 fields are street addresses and some are PO boxes - etc.  Lots of cleanup to do.

investigate putting Director's contact info as address line 3 and ILL contact as country - or find a way to do both in country or something.
