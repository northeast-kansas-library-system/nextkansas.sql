<p>Monthly overview - borrower statistics</p> 
<ul><li>Shows borrower counts for the previous calendar month</li> 
<li>At all Next Search Catalog libraries</li> 
<li>grouped and sorted by branch name</li> 
</ul><br /> 
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Generates data for:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>BORROWER_ACCT_USED_LM = number of borrower accounts used to check out materials last month</li> 
  <li>TOTAL_BORROWERS = number of total borrowers with this home library</li> 
  <li>B_ADDED_LM = number of borrowers with this home library added last month</li> 
  <li>B_RENEWED_LM = number of borrowers with this home library renewed last month</li> 
  <li>B_DELETED_LM = number of borrowers with this home library deleted last month</li> 
</ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>These counts are current at the time the report is run (which for Next Search Catalog is usually between 12:01 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. on the first day of the month).</p>
