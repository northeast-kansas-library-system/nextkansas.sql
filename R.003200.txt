<div id=reportinfo>
<p>Counts checkouts and renewals at a library during the previous calendar month based on whether the items circulated were owned by that library or owned by a different library</p>
<ul><li>Counts circulation and renewals in the previous calendar month</li>
<li>at all libraries</li>
<li>grouped and sorted by checkout branchcode</li>
</ul><br />
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p></p>
<p>Items that appear in the statistics table without a checkout branch are counted as NEKLS checkouts.</p>
<p>Items where the owning library cannot be determined will be counted as being owned by NEKLS.</p>
<p>All items owned by Doniphan County Library District are considered Doniphan County Library District items at all of their libraries - i.e. a DONITROY item checked out at DONIELWD counts as a DONIELWD item.</p>
<p>All items owned by Prairie Hills School District are considered Prairie Hills School District items at all of their libraries - i.e. a PHWAC item checked out at PHSHS counts as a PHSHS item.</p>
