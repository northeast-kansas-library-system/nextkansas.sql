<div id=reportinfo style="font-size:14px; font-weight:normal; background-color:#FFFF66">
<p>Report of possible duplicate borrowers at a library</p>
<ul><li>Shows patrons currently in the database</li>
<li>with at least one library account at the library you specify</li>
<li>grouped and sorted by last name/first name</li>
</ul><br />
<p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
<p></p>
<p>This report will only show you results where the last name and first name are a perfect match.  It will return a match if you have two patrons named John Smith.  But if one patron is named John J. Smith and the other is just named John Smith, it will not return a match.  The two names have to be identical.</p>
