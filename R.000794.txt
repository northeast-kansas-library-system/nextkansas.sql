Enhanced! Logic - the items arriving at my branch are not my items.  Use 2-digit month '01' and 4-digit year '2011'.  All Branches.

SELECT branchtransfers.tobranch, COUNT(*) FROM branchtransfers LEFT JOIN items USING (itemnumber) WHERE (branchtransfers.tobranch != items.homebranch) AND (branchtransfers.tobranch != branchtransfers.frombranch) AND MONTH(branchtransfers.datesent)= <<Month>> and YEAR(branchtransfers.datesent) = <<Year>> GROUP BY branchtransfers.tobranch
